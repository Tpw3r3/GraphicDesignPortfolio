# GraphicDesignPortfolio

Property of Tasha Washington

Portfolio contains work I made using the Adobe Creative Cloud, Procreate, and an iPad app called ArtSet4.
There's a combination of pieces made for previous school assignments, as well as personal experiments
for additional practice and to create different textures and color combos.
