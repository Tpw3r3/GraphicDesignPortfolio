My graphic design pieces made using Illustrator, InDesign, and some Photoshop.

Book Cover includes pdfs with the final design and a process portfolio of some
of the initial parts of the process and some of the various design options I
created while working on the project.

The experimental pieces were playing with art styles, textures, and just
practicing various techniques.

The extinct infographic includes two pieces that are connected to each other
in this set.

The manifesto includes the "she believed she could so she did" jpg, that shows
some of the original designs for the project, but after taking a break from it,
I ended up creating the "Live In The Moment" posters. Screenshot-1 was the final
product of that assignment.

Misc contains a pdf of some of the Paul Rand posters I designed after being
assigned to research him and his art. There's a type book I designed to teach
and demonstrate various elements of typography. There's also jpg called Viruses,
where I created a heart wrapped and surrounded by a virus.

Swiss style includes pdfs of various timelines, posters, I designed after
researching the style and trying to incorporate the style into my designs while
sharing what I learned about the style.
